C/C++/C# has a way to compile their source code with the help of `Makefiles`,
but how about `Go`? Sure, it's minimalistic, you can just do `go build` and
you're done, but if you want to fine-tune something that one-liner turns into
a Bratwurst ðŸŒ­

[I've asked around][2] on the [#go-lang:matrix.org][1] room which alternatives exist
and got 2 tools so far.

# Task

Task is a task runner / build tool that aims to be simpler and easier to use
than, for example, GNU Make.

# Mage

    >}}

Mage is a make/rake-like build tool using Go. You write plain-old go functions,
and Mage automatically uses them as Makefile-like runnable targets.
