This is the 2nd year conferences are being virtual and we can only benefit
from this. Some of time are free whilst some, more popular, require a small
fee.

The topics these conferences cover mostly relate to the SRE (Site Reliability
Engineer) role and they cover topics like:
* Security & DevSecOps
* Observability
* Multicloud
* Enterprise IT Infrastructure
* Kubernetes
* GitOps
* CI/CD (Continous Integration/Continous Deployment/Delivery)
