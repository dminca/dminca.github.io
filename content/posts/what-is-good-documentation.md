What is good documentation, how does it look like and where can I find it?
There's always that moment in the life of an engineer when you sit in front
of your laptop with your warm cup of coffee/tea and a blank page opened, trying
to come up with a beginning of that documentation page for your team.

Beginnings are always harsh, unfortunately you can only overcome them by just
writing something, even a bare brain-dump. Keep in mind, when you start writing
a docu, the initial version is always a **Draft**.

We've all skimmed through <abbr title="Request For Comments">RFCs</abbr> and
have noticed some of them are in **Status: Draft**; why, because they have to
be peer-reviewed. You've marked a document **Standard** when everyone reviewed
and proofed it of grammar and typos.

Here are some good examples of *actionable* documentation.

# Discord releases

Version releases are also documentation. Discord writes them in a *fun way*, so
imho I call this *fun documentation*.

    alt="Discord release notes with a header image of a globe and a satellite spinning around it"
    caption="Discord app release notes; love the 'I gotchu' link"
    >}}

If you click on the *I gotchu* link, you'll end up on another *fun docu* page
with pictures and explanations of what's new! Now this is the kind of page that
never tires a reader. Sure, *an image is a thousand words*, but there are also
gifs with interactive actions being explained, take a look

{{< figure
    src="/IMG_0539.jpeg"
    alt="Discord documentation page showing how to add required permissions to users in voice chat"
    caption="Bullet points with instructions, clear info bubble and a picture to explain features clearly to the User [source](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4412085582359-Text-Channels-Text-Chat-In-Voice-Channels)"
    >}}

You can clearly distinguish from this picture a simple guideline with bullet
point steps with detailed actions required from the User. Not only that, an
information bubble (green background) emphasizes key elements to the reader,
something like <abbr title="For Your Information">FYI</abbr>.

    alt="Discord documentation page explaining notification bubbles and message previews"
    caption="Even the smallest details like the notification bubble is explained by Discord team; now that's attention to detail"
    >}}


# Memgraph documentation

{{< figure
    src="/IMG_0537.jpeg"
    alt="Memgraph documentation with programming language logos in boxes to drill down into driver connectivity"
    caption="Driver connection links can be interracted even from small touch devices [source](https://memgraph.com/docs/memgraph/connect-to-memgraph)"
    >}}

Memgraph have done a good job here laying down the driver connectivity via
the aforementioned programming languages, all clearly distinguished in their
own boxes.

# Closing notes

What's common on both documentation pages (Memgraph and Discord) is at the
footer they have a way of collecting user feedback. It's a simple question
that doesn't require any account, just a humble *yes or no*. You can also see how many
people found it useful.
