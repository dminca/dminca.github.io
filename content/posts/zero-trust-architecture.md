summary: |
  Conventional network security has focused on perimeter defenses, but many
  organizations no longer have a clearly-defined perimeter. To protect a
  modern digital enterprise, organizations need a comprehensive strategy for
  secure “anytime, anywhere” access to their corporate resources (e.g.,
  applications, legacy systems, data, and devices) regardless of where they
  are located.
